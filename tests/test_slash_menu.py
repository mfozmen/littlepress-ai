"""Tests for the slash-command catalogue and the `/` auto-completion menu.

The catalogue (``SLASH_COMMANDS``) drives three things:
- Registration order in ``Repl._commands`` (which ``/help`` prints).
- Completion ordering in the CLI's ``Completer``.
- A single source of truth for command descriptions.
