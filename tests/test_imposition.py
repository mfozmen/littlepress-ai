# The source PDF produced by ``build_pdf`` is always
# ``[cover, story_1 .. story_k, back_cover]``. When we pad to a
# multiple of 4 for saddle-stitch, blanks MUST land in real-book
# "natural" positions so the printed booklet reads correctly after
# folding:
#
#   * reader position 1 = outside front cover  (source page 1)
#   * reader position total = outside back cover (source page n)
#   * story starts on a recto (right-hand) page whenever possible
#
# The old rule padded with ``None`` at the END of the source list, so
# back cover landed on an interior recto and the outside-back face of
# the booklet was blank. ``_reader_sequence`` fixes that by putting
# one blank immediately after the cover (moving story to a recto) and
# the remaining blanks immediately before the back cover.
