"""Unit tests for src/pages.py drawing helpers.

The renderer is inherently side-effecting (it writes into a PDF Canvas),
so these tests drive each layout path through an in-memory Canvas and
trust that calling the real ReportLab code without errors is enough.
The point is to exercise every branch: image-full, image-bottom,
image-top (default), text-only, plus _wrap and _draw_text_block edge
cases that the book-level tests in test_build.py miss.
