A print-ready PDF generator for children's picture books. The goal is simple: **a child should feel like a real author.** Feed it a JSON description (title, author, page texts, illustrations) and it produces an A5 picture book plus an optional A4 imposed booklet ready to fold and staple.

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

DejaVu Sans is located automatically on Windows / Linux / macOS. If it cannot be found, drop `DejaVuSans.ttf` and `DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf` into a `fonts/` folder next to `build.py`.

## Usage

```bash
# A5 picture book only
python build.py book.json

# A5 + A4 imposed booklet (print double-sided, fold, staple)
python build.py book.json --impose

# Custom output path
python build.py book.json -o output/my-book.pdf
```

## Try the example

A minimal, self-contained example lives under `examples/`. Run:

```bash
python build.py examples/book.json -o output/example.pdf
```

This produces a 2-page A5 picture book from the sample `examples/book.json` and the placeholder illustrations in `examples/images/`. Use it as a template for your own book.

## Project layout

- `build.py` — CLI entry point
- `src/` — generator modules (schema, layout, PDF assembly, imposition, ingestion)
- `examples/` — a runnable sample book (`book.json` + placeholder PNGs)
- `tests/` — pytest suite, mirrors `src/`
- `output/` — generated PDFs (gitignored)
- your own `book.json` + `images/` at the repo root — private user content, gitignored

## `book.json` schema

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "author": "...",
  "cover":      { "image": "images/...", "subtitle": "..." },
  "pages":      [{ "text": "...", "image": "images/...", "layout": "image-top" }],
  "back_cover": { "text": "...", "image": null }
}
```

Valid `layout` values: `image-top`, `image-bottom`, `image-full`, `text-only`.

## Printing the A4 booklet

Print the `_A4_booklet.pdf` on A4 paper **double-sided, flipped on the short edge**. Fold the stack in half and staple along the spine — you now have an A5 book.

## Testing

The project follows **test-driven development**. Every feature and bug fix starts with a failing test.

```bash
pytest                               # full suite
pytest --cov=src --cov=build         # with coverage (reported to SonarCloud)
```

## Roadmap

The next milestone is a **dynamic ingestion pipeline**: drop in a PDF draft (scanned handwriting + drawings) and get a polished book automatically — with the child's original words preserved as the source of truth.

- [x] Static pipeline: `book.json` → A5 PDF / A4 booklet
- [x] `src/pdf_ingest.extract_pages()` — raw per-page text extraction
- [ ] Embedded image extraction from PDF
- [ ] `book.json` synthesis from extracted content
- [ ] `build.py --from-pdf <path>` CLI integration
- [ ] Handwriting OCR (opt-in, behind a flag — mechanical misread fixes only, never rewrites)
