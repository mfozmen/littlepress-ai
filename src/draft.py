"""In-memory representation of a PDF draft being worked on in the REPL.

Unlike ``src/schema.Book`` (which validates the finished product before
rendering), ``Draft`` is deliberately lenient: a freshly-ingested PDF
may still be missing a title, cover, or per-page text. The REPL walks
the user through filling those gaps; only then is a ``Book`` built and
rendered.

Preserve-child-voice: nothing in this module rewrites page text. The
ingestion path just copies what ``src/pdf_ingest`` returned.

    Why: the draft's ``source_pdf`` and persisted memory both key off
    the PDF's absolute path. If the original lives outside the project
    (Downloads, Desktop, …) a later move or ``rm`` breaks the session
    because we can't match what's saved. Copying into a path we control
    decouples the user's file-system hygiene from the project state.

    Name scheme: ``<stem>-<sha256[:8]><suffix>``. The content hash in
    the filename is deterministic (same bytes → same path → shared
    memory, correct: it's the same book) while collision-safe by
    construction (different bytes → different path → separate
    memories). Bare basenames would cross-wire two drafts that happen
    to share a name; that's the regression this helper protects
    against.

    Idempotent: if the destination already exists, we hand it back
    without touching it (same hash ⇒ same bytes, no need to rewrite).
    If the source is already inside the input directory — e.g. the
    user did ``/load .book-gen/input/draft-<hash>.pdf`` — we return
    it unchanged so the helper never copies a file onto itself.

    downstream would then hand that corrupt file to the user's PDF

    is atomic on both POSIX and Windows, so observers either see the

    On Windows, ``os.replace`` raises ``PermissionError`` if ``dst`` is
