"""Tools the agent can call.

Each factory takes the *state accessors* the tool needs (e.g. a callable
that returns the currently-loaded Draft) and returns a ``Tool`` the agent
can register. Keeping state out of the tool signature itself means tools
stay testable without spinning up a full REPL.

**Preserve-child-voice is enforced by gating every mutation of the
child's content behind a user y/n confirm.** "The child's content"
means page text, page image, and whole-page removal — the parts of
the draft that came from the child's hand. Presentation choices
(metadata, cover, single-page layout) can land directly because
they're authoring decisions on top of the content, not the content
itself.

Content-gated tools (require a ``confirm: Callable[[str], bool]``):

- ``propose_typo_fix`` — narrow substring substitutions on ``page.text``,
  bounded in length so the tool can't funnel a rewrite.
- ``transcribe_page`` — OCR via the active LLM's vision; writes
  ``page.text`` and, by default, clears ``page.image`` and switches
  the layout to ``text-only``. A ``keep_image`` flag preserves a
  separate drawing on mixed-content pages.
- ``skip_page`` — removes a whole page from ``draft.pages`` and
  renumbers the rest; the confirm explicitly warns when the dropped
  page carries a drawing.
- ``generate_cover_illustration`` — AI cover generation with a
  pricing-aware confirm that shows the prompt and the quality-tier
  cost estimate before any API call.
- ``generate_page_illustration`` — AI page illustration; same
  confirm shape as the cover tool. Pairs with ``transcribe_page``
  to give a page a fresh drawing after the source image was cleared.

Also user-gated (not strictly "content" but coordinated changes that
warrant a single explicit approval):

- ``propose_layouts`` — batch layout tool, one y/n for the whole
  rhythm. Presentation-only but wholesale, so the user reviews the
  full plan before it lands.

Not gated — read-only or presentation-only, land directly:

- ``read_draft`` — returns the current draft for the agent to see.
- ``set_metadata`` — title, author, back-cover blurb,
  cover subtitle.
- ``set_cover`` — cover image choice and template style.
- ``choose_layout`` — single-page layout change (presentation only).
- ``render_book`` — builds the finished PDF. Pure disk side-effect;
  never mutates the draft.

If a future tool ships that mutates ``page.text``, ``page.image``, or
removes a page without a ``confirm`` callback, that's a
preserve-child-voice violation and belongs behind one.

       now forwards the image content block in its native wire
       format (OpenAI multi-modal content array, Gemini
       ``Part(inline_data=Blob(...))``, Ollama ``images`` list).
    2. **User confirmation.** The OCR reply is shown to the user

       ``propose_typo_fix``. An existing transcription is surfaced
       in the prompt so the user sees what's being overwritten.
    3. **Verbatim prompt.** The vision prompt tells the model to
       output the text exactly as written — no typo fixes, no
       "polish," no paraphrase.

    surfacing a "couldn't open viewer" in the agent reply would be
