"""Tools the agent can call.

Each factory takes the *state accessors* the tool needs (e.g. a callable
that returns the currently-loaded Draft) and returns a ``Tool`` the agent
can register. Keeping state out of the tool signature itself means tools
stay testable without spinning up a full REPL.

**Preserve-child-voice is enforced by two invariants**, not by per-call
confirm gates:

1. **The input is immutable.** Nothing in this module deletes, rewrites,
   or renames the mirrored source PDF under ``.book-gen/input/`` or the
   per-page drawings ``pdf_ingest`` extracts to
   ``.book-gen/images/page-NN.*``. ``restore_page`` relies on them still
   being on disk.

2. **The child's words reach the printed page verbatim.** Every path
   that writes ``page.text`` either goes through a verbatim-only prompt
   (``transcribe_page`` asks the vision model for a byte-for-byte
   transcription, three-sentinel classifier; ``propose_typo_fix`` is
   bounded to 3 words / 30 chars per side so it can't funnel a rewrite)
   or copies a user-supplied string with NO model in between
   (``apply_text_correction``).

Per-mutation y/n confirm callbacks are gone. The tools that used to
carry them auto-apply; the user audits the finished PDF in the
post-render review turn and corrects any mistake via
``apply_text_correction`` / ``restore_page`` / ``hide_page``.

Tool groups:

- **Content tools, auto-apply (no confirm):** ``propose_typo_fix``,
  ``transcribe_page``, ``propose_layouts``, ``hide_page``.
- **Presentation / read-only (no confirm):** ``read_draft``,
  ``set_metadata``, ``set_cover``, ``choose_layout``, ``render_book``.
- **Cost-gated (single pricing confirm, not content):**
  ``generate_cover_illustration``, ``generate_page_illustration``.
- **Review-turn only (user-initiated, no confirm):**
  ``apply_text_correction``, ``restore_page``. The agent must NOT
  initiate these on its own — they only fire in response to a user
  correction in the post-render review loop.

If a future tool ships that mutates ``page.text``, ``page.image``, or
removes a page without going through either a verbatim-only prompt or a
user-supplied string, that's a preserve-child-voice violation.

        #      ``<TEXT>``-classified page (image=None,
        #      layout=text-only) — the new image lands but the
