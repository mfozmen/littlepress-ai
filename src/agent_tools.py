"""Tools the agent can call.

Each factory takes the *state accessors* the tool needs (e.g. a callable
that returns the currently-loaded Draft) and returns a ``Tool`` the agent
can register. Keeping state out of the tool signature itself means tools
stay testable without spinning up a full REPL.

Preserve-child-voice lives in the tool *surface*: there is **no tool that
rewrites page text freely**. The only way page text ever changes is
``propose_typo_fix``, which requires a user y/n and rejects anything
beyond mechanical substring substitutions.
