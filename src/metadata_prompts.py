"""Deterministic metadata prompts — Sub-project 2 of the
"AI-only-for-judgment" refactor.

Before this module existed, the agent greeting told the LLM to walk
the user through a block of upfront questions (title, author, series,
cover choice, back-cover blurb). That worked, but burned an LLM round
trip per answer and gave the model latitude to restructure the flow,
skip questions, or add prose the user had to read and dismiss. None
of those questions actually need AI — they are pure data collection.

These helpers are pure functions that run in the REPL between
ingestion and the agent's first turn. The LLM is invoked only when
the user explicitly opts into an AI branch (AI cover generation in
``collect_cover_choice``, AI back-cover draft in ``collect_back_cover``
— both still live in the agent tool surface; these helpers only
decide *whether* to take that path based on the user's menu choice).

Design notes:

- Every session is treated as fresh. Prompts do NOT check whether the
  draft already has a value and skip — they ask unconditionally. See
  memory feedback ``fresh_session_per_book``: the user's mental model
  is "create a book, finish, forget"; memory-restore UX adds cognitive
  load without solving a real problem for this workflow.

- preserve-child-voice applies. User-typed strings are written
  verbatim to the draft. ``strip()`` on outer whitespace only (paste
  trails); no smart-casing, no Unicode normalisation, no spellcheck.

- Series membership lives INSIDE the title (e.g. ``My Book - 1``) so
  the cover renderer picks it up naturally — no separate data field.
