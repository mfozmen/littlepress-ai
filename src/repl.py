    choices.

    Deterministic cover branches (``page-drawing`` / ``poster``)
    inject an explicit COVER STATE block so the agent doesn't
    misread the draft state and "helpfully" call ``set_cover`` —
    that's what triggered the cover-override bug reported on the
    2026-04-26 live render (user picked poster, got a page-drawing
    cover because the agent saw ``cover_image=None`` and inferred
    the cover wasn't configured yet).

    The AI branches (``cover == "ai"``, ``back_cover == "ai-draft"``)
    inject their judgment-instruction block instead — that path
    legitimately calls ``set_cover`` (via
    ``generate_cover_illustration``) so the COVER STATE warning
    doesn't apply.

    Deterministic back-cover branches (``none`` / ``self-written``)
    don't have an analogous override risk today (``set_metadata``
    on ``back_cover_text`` is the only path the agent has, and the
    same "metadata is already set" framing covers it), so no
    per-branch state block is injected for the back cover.

    Default ``None`` for both args produces a NEUTRAL greeting with
    no cover-state block and no AI block — the shape used by the
    backwards-compat ``_AGENT_GREETING_HINT`` constant for tests
    that don't care about per-branch behaviour. Real sessions
    always pass explicit values from ``MetadataChoices``.

    Unknown values raise ``ValueError`` rather than falling through
