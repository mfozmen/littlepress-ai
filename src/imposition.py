    """Return a reader-order list of length multiple-of-4 where padding
    ``None`` slots land in real-book "natural" positions.

    The source PDF produced by ``build_pdf`` is always structured as
    ``[cover, story_1 .. story_k, back_cover]``. A printed booklet
    must read in this physical order after folding:

      * reader position 1 = outside front cover (source page 1)
      * reader position ``total`` = outside back cover (source page n)
      * story starts on a recto (right-hand page) whenever possible

    Rule: if any padding is needed, insert **one blank immediately
    after the cover** (which moves story 1 onto a recto) and place
    the remaining ``pad - 1`` blanks immediately **before the back
    cover**. If ``n_pages`` is already a multiple of 4, no blanks are
    inserted — accepting that in that edge case story 1 lands on the
    verso of the cover. The alternative (forcing a recto by adding
    four extra blanks) would waste an entire A4 sheet for aesthetics,
    and the rendered A5 PDF still reads correctly; the booklet
    imposition is the only side that benefits from recto-start.

    Replaces the old pad-at-end behaviour where padding ``None`` slots
    were appended to the source list, which caused the back cover to
    land on an interior recto and the booklet's outside-back face to
    come out blank — a bug surfaced the first time a real booklet was
    folded.
