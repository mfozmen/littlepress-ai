# Agent-first pivot — status (2026-04-14)

Planned in April 2026 after the slash-command era got too feature-heavy. Pivoted to an **agent-driven** CLI: the user points at a PDF, a model walks the conversation, the book comes out the other side.

## Shipped

All five PRs from the original plan merged:

| PR | Branch | What it shipped |
|---|---|---|
| #13 | `feat/agent-core` | `src/agent.py` tool-use loop; `read_draft` tool; `child-book-generator draft.pdf` auto-loads the draft. |
| #14 | `feat/agent-edit-tools` | `propose_typo_fix` (bounded + user y/n), `set_metadata`, `set_cover`, `choose_layout`. **preserve-child-voice enforced at the tool surface** — no tool rewrites page text. |
| #15 | `feat/agent-render` | `render_book` tool produces the A5 PDF and optional A4 booklet. |
| #16 | `feat/project-memory` | `.book-gen/draft.json` persists title / author / cover / layouts / edits across launches; atomic write, schema-versioned, path-normalised. |
| #17 | `chore/cleanup` | Consolidated `slugify`, refreshed CLAUDE.md / README to describe the agent flow. |

## "Done when" checklist

- [x] `child-book-generator some-draft.pdf` produces a printable A5 (and optional A4 booklet) in 5-10 minutes of conversation.
- [x] The child's story text is never silently rewritten (no tool allows it).
- [x] Re-running on the same draft uses remembered choices and asks only about what changed.
- [x] Codebase stays small enough for one person to hold in their head (~13 `src/` modules, each with a single clear role).

## Intentionally kept (earlier cleanup candidates)

- `_CHECKERS` placeholder in `src/providers/validator.py` — extension point for OpenAI / Gemini / Ollama key validation.
- Slash commands (`/load /title /render /model /pages /author /help /exit`) — escape hatches for offline mode, agent outage, or "skip the agent" use.
- `Draft` vs `Book` — different jobs (lenient editable vs strict renderer-facing). `to_book` is the validation boundary.
- `examples/book.json` + placeholder PNGs — used by `tests/test_build.py` to smoke the standalone renderer.

## Explicitly deferred (don't build unless asked)

- **Keyring / persisted API key.** Re-prompting each launch is fine.
- **Illustration generation.** Separate project.
- **OCR for handwritten scans.** Current PDFs have extractable text; add when a real draft needs it.
- **Full parametric layout engine.** `choose_layout` applies the skill's rule 1 and simple aspect-ratio branching; parametric splits can wait.
- **Multi-provider `chat()` implementations.** OpenAI / Gemini / Ollama adapters are one file each when requested; `NullProvider` covers the offline path until then.
